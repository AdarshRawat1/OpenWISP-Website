        <h2 id="docker">Dockerization of OpenWISP 2</h2>
        <p><strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong> Python, Bash, Docker, Docker Compose, OpenVPN.</p>

        <p>
        	The current automated <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2">
          deployment procedure for OpenWISP 2 is based on Ansible</a> and has served
          us well until today but has some limitations that make it unsuited for
          more complex deployments that need horizontal scaling, custom setups
          and easily replicable deployments.
        </p>

        <p>
        	This project idea aims to develop an automated deployment procedure
          based on Docker and Docker Compose, mixing in also other technologies
          like Python and Shell scripts to glue together all the pieces needed
          to achieve it.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also aim to provide a fully working OpenWISP instance that
          includes a management VPN (based on OpenVPN) that works out
          of the box and is pre-configured in OpenWISP.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keep in mind that some parts of some OpenWISP may need to be changed
          to make the dockerization easier, so if you want to work on this
          project you must be familiar with changing the internals of OpenWISP modules.
        </p>

                Find out the right balance between efficiency, configurability and
                simplicity by leveraging the docker features like base images,
                build arguments, multi stage builds and any other tool that may

                    <li>Provide a celery worker, initially used only by OpenWISP Controller
                        (<code>connections</code> branch), but which later will executes background
                        tasks of other modules as well, in a dedicated container.
                    </li>
                    <li>Provide a dedicated container for celery-beat

                        and a related VPN client template
                        (ask questions to your mentors to know more about this),
                        the OpenVPN configuration used in the container shall be kept in sync with the
                        definition available in the VPN Server of OpenWISP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide mounted volumes that allow to store persistently
                        files that are uploaded by users (eg: floor plan images).
                    </li>
                    <li>Provide the OpenWISP Radius views and APIs in a dedicated container</li>
                    <li>
                        Provide a configurable freeradius instance in a dedicated container
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide a dedicated container with an nginx instance which
                        has HTTP 2, IPv6 and Gzip enabled by deafult
                        (but can be turned off if needed)
                        that dispatches HTTP requests to the different containers,
                        depending on which domain is called
                        (eg: dashboard.mydomain.com for the admin container,
                         controller.mydomain.com for openwisp-controller container
                         and so on);
                        Allow to provide custom settings for each site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure each OpenWISP module and its related services
                        can be turned off if not needed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide a PostgreSQL instance in a dedicated container,
                        ensure all the other services point to this postgres
                        instance, ensure the data is stored on persistent storage,
                        allow using a PostgreSQL hosted elsewhere as an alternative
                        (some users may want to use managed PostgreSQL services)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide a redis instance in a dedicated container
                        and ensure the django settings point to it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide a deafult working postfix instance which is
                        able to send emails but can also be turned off
                        (users may want to use an external SMTP service)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The different containers may have very similar or some times
                identical django settings but we need to absolutely avoid
                having to manually maintain duplicated settings;
                find a way to manage the django settings of OpenWISP efficiently
                and in a way that allows to avoid duplication between the
                different services
            </li>
            <li>
                Customizability: it should be possible to use custom Docker images
                and custom django settings for OpenWISP in order to ensure that
                different users can deploy their tailored OpenWISP based
                network automation solution
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow users to easily configure some django settings:
                <ul>
                    <li>CORS settings</li>
                    <li>Sentry logging (including the celery container)
                        using the more recent <code>sentry_sdk</code>
                        (in ansible-openwisp2 we use the old pyhon-raven module)
                    </li>
                    <li>DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL</li>
                    <li>SMTP settings</li>
                    <li>language code</li>
                    <li>timezone</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement automated testing with basic checks for each service,
                eg: for the admin interface, send and HTTP request expecting to see the login page
                (at least one similar checks should be implemented for each service)
            </li>
            <li>
                Include installation, upgrade and usage information as well as
                an explaination of configuration settings in the README.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="netengine">netengine: pull monitoring info from network devices</h2>
        <p><strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong> python, NetJSON, SNMP, HTTP, OpenWRT, Linux.</p>

        <p>
        	Netengine is a python library that aims to provide a single API
        	to extract common information from network devices using different protocols
        	(eg: SNMP, SSH, HTTP) and different firwmares (eg: OpenWRT, AirOS).
        </p>

        <p>
        	The library kinda worked but was not brought to production level work
        	and since OpenWISP 2 is going to have a monitoring system soon, wa want
        	to rewrite this library to bring its implementation to production level.
        </p>

        <p>
        	<strong>NOTE</strong>: backward compatibility does not have to be maintained
        	we can freely change and improve the API and internal structure of the library
        	if we think the change is going to improve the quality of the implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
        	<strong>WARNING</strong>: to work on this project you need an AirOS device;
        	OpenWRT can be installed in a virtual box VM, but AirOS cannot (at least
        	not as easily). If you don't have an AirOS device compatible with the latest
        	version and you do not indend to buy one you cannot work on this project.<br>
        	If it ever happens that you get accepted but you fail to buy an AirOS device,
        	you will be failed.

        for community networks. Now is time to start implementing NetJSON in a lower level of the stack and the next
        natural step in that direction is to implement it in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/ubus">ubus (OpenWrt micro bus architecture)</a>,
        which is included by default in <a href="http://www.lede-project.org/">LEDE</a> and <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>, the two linux distributions
        commonly used with OpenWISP.
        </p>
        <p>In this project the student will have to develop ubus API extensions that allow retrieving monitoring informatio in NetJSON format
        	(<a href="http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#devicemonitoring">NetJSON DeviceMonitoring</a>) from ubus.
