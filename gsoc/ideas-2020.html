        <h2 id="merging-openwisp-moodules">Merge OpenWISP django modules</h2>
        <p><strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong> python, django.</p>
        <p>
            OpenWISP 2 is composed of several python package, some of which are
            decoupled from the rest of OpenWISP, this has been done for good reasons
            which are described in the following section of our documentation:
            <a href="http://openwisp.io/docs/general/values.html#software-reusability-means-long-term-sustainability">
                OpenWISP values: software reusability means long term sustainability
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            After some years in which OpenWISP 2 has been deployed and maintained
            we came to the conclusion that in some cases we went a bit too far
            with this practice, which has resulted counterproductive in some cases
            because it increases maintenance overhead and complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this project idea is to merge some modules which perform
            identical operations (although with some distinction) in order to
            bring down the complexity of OpenWISP, hence lowering maintenance costs
            while keeping the extensibility and reusability of these key modules.
        </p>
        <p>
            These modules are:
        </p>
        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller">openwisp-controller</a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-netjsonconfig">django-netjsonconfig</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology">openwisp-network-topology</a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-netjsongraph">django-netjsongraph</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-radius">openwisp-radius</a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-freeradius">django-freeradius</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-ipam">openwisp-ipam</a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-ipam">django-ipam</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of this pair performs the same function, the package prefixed with "openwisp-",
            for example "openwisp-ipam" extends a base package
            (in the case of this example it's django-ipam)
            and adds features that are specific to OpenWISP, like multitenancy
            (different organization using the same application without interfering with one another).
        </p>
        <p>
            This separation over time is brought more complexity than advantages to the project,
            so it's now time to put a stop to it. We just have to make sure each OpenWISP
            module is still extensible and reusable so other developers can use it as a base
            for their custom applications.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Measurable outcomes:</strong></p>
        <ul class="ui bulleted link list">
            <li>Merge django-ipam into openwisp-ipam</li>
            <li>Merge django-netjsonconfig into openwisp-controller</li>
            <li>Merge django-netjsongraph into openwisp-network-topology</li>
            <li>Merge django-freeradius into openwisp-radius</li>
            <li>
                Migrate the django settings of each module so that the naming is consistent.
                For example, all settings of django netjsonconfig are prefixed as
                <code>NETJSONCONFIG_[SETTING_NAME]</code> and have to be renamed as
                <code>OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_[SETTING_NAME]</code> but backward compatibility
                with the old name must be kept in order to facilitate migration:
                the old name should be checked first, if a setting with the old naming is
                present, the application should use it but also log a warning to
                encourage the users to upgrade the name of the setting.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure <a href="https://github.com/wq/django-swappable-models">django-swappable-models</a>
                are implemented in each merged module and the naming of the swappable settings is consistent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide ways to import, extend and override each key area of the application.
                Examples:
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-netjsongraph#extending-django-netjsongraph">extending django-netjsongraph</a>,
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-netjsonconfig#id2">Extending django-netjsonconfig</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure tests of each merged module are reusable as it's currently done in
                django-ipam and django-freeradius
            </li>
            <li>
                Each module shall have has a <code>sample_app</code> in its test suite that extends the main module,
                adding some changes on top of it with the sole purpose of testing its extensibility.<br>
                In order to better understand this concept take a look at how it's currently implemented in
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-freeradius/search?q=sample_app&unscoped_q=sample_app">django-freeradius</a>. and
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-ipam/search?q=sample_app&unscoped_q=sample_app">django-ipam</a>
                (we must port the same concept into the merged modules).
            </li>
            <li>
                Update the documentation of each merged module
                (eg: documentation of django-netjsonconfig has to be merged in
                openwisp-controller and adapted).
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure all tests pass and test coverage remains stable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a branch on
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2">ansible-openwisp2</a>
                which makes it work with the new merged modules.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a branch on
                <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp">docker-openwisp</a>

        <h2 id="netengine">netengine: pull monitoring info from network devices</h2>
        <p><strong>Languages &amp; technologies used:</strong> python, NetJSON, SNMP, HTTP, OpenWRT, Linux.</p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/netengine">Netengine</a>
            is a python library that aims to provide a single API
            to extract common information from network devices using different protocols
            (eg: SNMP, SSH, HTTP) and different firwmares (eg: OpenWRT, AirOS).
        </p>

        <p>
            The library kinda worked but was not brought to production level work
            and since OpenWISP 2 is going to have a monitoring system soon, wa want
            to rewrite this library to bring its implementation to production level.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>NOTE</strong>: backward compatibility does not have to be maintained
            we can freely change and improve the API and internal structure of the library
            if we think the change is going to improve the quality of the implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>WARNING</strong>: to work on this project you need an AirOS device;
            OpenWRT can be installed in a virtual box VM, but AirOS cannot (at least
            not as easily). If you don't have an AirOS device compatible with the latest
            version and you do not indend to buy one you cannot work on this project.<br>
            If it ever happens that you get accepted but you fail to buy an AirOS device,
            you will be failed.

        <p><a href="http://netjson.org">NetJSON</a> is emerging as a common format to exchange configuration and monitoring information
        from network devices. Year after year it's becoming easier to achieve interoperability between different software packages
        for networking software. Now is time to start implementing NetJSON in a lower level of the stack and the next
        natural step in that direction is to implement it in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/ubus">ubus (OpenWrt micro bus architecture)</a>,
